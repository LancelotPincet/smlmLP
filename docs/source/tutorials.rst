Tutorials
=========

In this section, we will showcase different in-depth example using **smlmLP** for some typical usage.

For me, there is no better way to learn a library than through manipulating some problems yourself.
That is why I propose a series of exercices to try out yourself as tutorials.
You should first try solving them by yourself with the help of the two previous sections, than compare with correction!

1. First, we will start with an :ref:`introductory exercice <introductory_exercice>` to check you got the basics.
2. Then, we will dive into a more :ref:`typical exercice <typical_exercice>` you might encounter frequently.
3. Finally, we will go through an :ref:`advanced exercice <advanced_exercice>` for motivated developers.
